✔ Yes, you CAN implement localStorage without Redux
✔ Redux does NOT depend on localStorage
✔ Redux just makes persistence clean, centralized, and scalable
✔ For real-world apps → Redux + localStorage is preferred



🟢 OPTION 1 — Small app (acceptable, not ideal)
Put localStorage logic directly in store.js.

This is okay when:
Only one persisted slice (tasks)
Learning phase
No middleware yet

Example (conceptually):
read localStorage before store creation
subscribe and save after store creation

➡️ No separate file needed
👍 Good for learning
👎 Not scalable






🟡 OPTION 2 — BEST PRACTICE (what professionals do)
👉 Create a small utility file for persistence

📁 Suggested structure
redux/
 ├─ store.js
 ├─ reducer.js
 ├─ taskAction.js
 ├─ taskType.js
 └─ storage.js   ← ✅

What goes in storage.js?
Only pure helper functions, like:
load state from localStorage
save state to localStorage
Redux will use these helpers, but they stay isolated.

Why this is best
✔ Separation of concerns
✔ Cleaner store.js
✔ Easier to test
✔ Easy to replace localStorage later
✔ Scales well

➡️ This is the recommended choice for your app





🔴 OPTION 3 — Advanced apps (not now)

Use:
Redux middleware
redux-persist

This is for:
auth tokens
encrypted storage
versioned migrations

🚫 Overkill for your current stage
